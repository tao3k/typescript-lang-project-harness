# Runner Modes

The harness exposes two runner modes with shared configuration. Every report
includes both `runMode` and a reasoning tree whose own `runMode` matches it, so
downstream tools can branch on runner semantics without inspecting optional
project facts.

## Project Runner

Use `runTypeScriptProjectHarness()` or
`assertTypeScriptProjectHarnessClean()` when a caller has a project path. The
requested path must exist. The runner resolves the nearest parent
`package.json` as the package project anchor, reads a local `tsconfig.json` in
that package root, parses it with TypeScript's native config parser, builds a
reasoning tree from parser-owned facts, and evaluates the default rule packs
over that reasoning tree. Project runs also collect TypeScript `Program` semantic
diagnostics as parser-owned facts and expose them through reasoning-tree
diagnostics as non-blocking advice.

When no config file exists, the runner falls back to recursive TypeScript file
discovery and emits `TS-PROJ-R001` from the reasoning tree's missing
`configPath` fact. That fallback is for early bootstrap and editor-oriented
use; long-lived projects should declare `tsconfig.json` so the harness sees the
same source set TypeScript sees.
If `tsconfig.json` enables `allowJs`, JavaScript files selected by TypeScript's
config parser are parsed through the same native `Program`; the fallback
discovery path does not infer JavaScript ownership on its own.

## Configuration

`TypeScriptHarnessConfig` owns parser inclusion and assertion policy:

```ts
import { defaultTypeScriptHarnessConfig } from "typescript-lang-project-harness";

const config = {
  ...defaultTypeScriptHarnessConfig(),
  includeTests: false,
  sourceDirNames: ["lib"],
  testDirNames: ["spec"],
};
```

`ignoredDirNames` controls recursive fallback discovery. `blockingSeverities`
keeps assertion behavior independent from rule emission. `disabledRuleIds`
and `disabledRulePacks` suppress selected findings, while
`ruleSeverityOverrides` and `rulePackSeverityOverrides` tune severity after
rule evaluation. Single-rule severity overrides win over rule-pack overrides.
`blockingRuleIds` lets a project promote specific advisory rules without
changing catalog severities. Semantic
diagnostics, project-shape advice, modularity and test-layout rules, plus
malformed `package.json` metadata diagnostics, are rendered as `info` advice by
default. Package metadata diagnostics include root, TypeScript
project-reference, and workspace package files and are produced through
TypeScript's JSON parser. Package scripts and workspaces are parser-owned
orientation facts, not package-manager policy.
Known extension activation, such as Effect, is also parser-owned. The parser
may derive `packageExtensions` from package dependency fields and
`typescriptProjectHarness.extensions`, but rule packs consume only the typed
extension fact.
Known build-tool visibility, such as Rspack/Rsbuild, follows the same boundary.
The parser derives `packageBuildTools` from known dependency names, package
scripts, config files, and optional `typescriptProjectHarness.buildTools`
config. Rule packs consume that typed fact for low-noise agent advice; they do
not parse shell scripts as a package-manager policy or replace bundler tooling.

`assertTypeScriptProjectHarnessClean()` follows the same blocking-only
semantics. `assertTypeScriptProjectHarnessAgentClean()` is the test-gate variant
for agent repair loops: it first enforces configured-blocking findings, then
fails with the compact advice renderer when visible `info` advice remains. It
does not bypass policy config; disabled rules, disabled packs, and severity
overrides are applied before the test-gate assertion sees findings.
`assertTypeScriptProjectHarnessEmbeddedClean()` is the npm test/check embedded
variant. It fails only on blocking findings and emits compact advice by
default. To keep test suites from running a second full type-check after `tsc`,
it defaults to skipping TypeScript semantic diagnostic collection while still
using native parser/project facts; callers can opt back in with
`collectSemanticDiagnostics: true`.

`verificationPolicy` is also part of `TypeScriptHarnessConfig`. It owns
profile hints, receipts, waivers, task contract overrides, responsibility task
mapping, skill bindings, and skill descriptors for the M5/M6/M7 verification
surface. These settings do not affect default rule-pack findings; they are
consumed by `buildTypeScriptVerificationProfileIndex*()` and
`planTypeScriptProjectVerification*()` after a report exists. Report bundle and
task-index renderers consume the resulting plan; they do not run external
skills.

The package facade exposes immutable helpers for common policy changes:
`withDisabledTypeScriptRule()`, `withDisabledTypeScriptRules()`,
`withDisabledTypeScriptRulePack()`, `withTypeScriptRuleSeverity()`,
`withTypeScriptRulePackSeverity()`, and
`withTypeScriptBlockingSeverities()`. Verification helpers include
`withTypeScriptVerificationProfileHint()`,
`withTypeScriptVerificationReceipt()`,
`withTypeScriptVerificationWaiver()`,
`withTypeScriptVerificationTaskContract()`,
`withTypeScriptVerificationResponsibilityTaskKinds()`,
`withTypeScriptVerificationSkillBinding()`, and
`withTypeScriptVerificationSkillDescriptor()`.

## Explicit-Path Runner

Use `runTypeScriptLangHarness()` or
`assertTypeScriptLangHarnessClean()` for explicit files or directories.
Requested paths must exist. This runner does not attach project scope, so
project-scoped evaluators stay quiet. It still builds a minimal reasoning tree
from parser-owned file facts, so file-local syntax diagnostics enter policy
through reasoning-tree diagnostic facts rather than parser module reports.

The explicit-path runner is useful for editor integrations, focused parser
checks, and small repair loops where the caller already knows the files to
inspect.

## Reasoning Tree Render

Reports always include a reasoning tree assembled from parser-owned facts.
`renderTypeScriptReasoningTree(report)` renders the Rust-style agent snapshot
shape: `Modules:`, `Extensions:`, `BuildTools:`, `OwnerBranches:`,
`OwnerDependencies:`, and `FindingGroups:`. It summarizes module roles, exports, path-alias/package
edges, package-name import owners, project-reference/workspace owner
provenance, package entry owners, known package extension/build-tool facts, and
Rust-style source-shape counters such as
`shadowed=` and `orphaned=` while omitting singleton and zero-value boilerplate.
Explicit-path reports use the same grouping surface, with diagnostics grouped
under `FindingGroups:` when rule findings exist. Full TypeScript diagnostic
codes and related information remain in compact findings and JSON output.
Parser-visible package `bin` owners are still classified as `entrypoint`
modules before entering this snapshot.

`runTypeScriptProjectHarnessAgentSnapshot()` and
`renderTypeScriptProjectHarnessAgentSnapshot()` provide the project-level
snapshot used by `--agent-snapshot`. The runner starts from the root package
report, follows parser-owned workspace and project-reference package facts, and
runs each member package from its own package anchor. The renderer adds compact
`pkg <path>` headings only when multiple package scopes produce source facts or
findings.

## Public Facade

Consumers should import from the package root. The root facade exposes the M13
contract: parser entrypoints, project/explicit runners, project snapshot
helpers, assertion helpers, compact/JSON/reasoning renderers, rule catalog
functions, policy config helpers, verification profile-index builders/renderers,
verification planners/renderers, verification task-index builders/renderers,
verification report-bundle builders/renderers, report writer helpers, and model
types, including `TypeScriptHarnessRunMode`, `TypeScriptRulePack`,
parser-native public API/data/control-flow fact types, M12 type-boundary fact
types, Effect extension fact types, and verification policy/task model types.
Reasoning builders, rule evaluators, and verification internals remain internal
implementation details.
